***Project: Information Architecture and Usability Redesign for the TechCrunch website***

The TechCrunch Website is a public news website that focuses on providing people with information and stories around technology, business, and startups. While the website has several pieces of information and many features, they are not organized in a way that makes it easy for users to find what they are looking for. My project will focus on understanding what users seek on TechCrunch and creating a UX that aligns with those needs as well as Nielson’s 10 Heuristics. My goal is to create a user experience that enables users to successfully find the content they are looking for and enjoy the process of consuming and interacting with the content.

**Evaluation**
Note: Severity Ratings are from 0-4 following Nielson’s scale of problems:
0: not classified as a usability problem
1: a cosmetic problem that will only be fixed is time allows
2: a minor usability problem that has a low fix priority
3: a major usability problem that is important to fix and therefore a high priority
4: a usability catastrophe that is imperative to fix before product release. (Nielsen, 1993)

**Tasks:** In order to evaluate the website I tried attempting the following tasks:
- Creating an account
- Logging in
- Searching for an article
- Registering for an event
- Commenting on an article

### 1. Visibility of System Status
*(Always keep users informed about what is going on. Provide appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.)*

**Severity rating: 3**

**Evaluation:**  
When it comes to providing users with the context of what the current state of the system is, the website does a decent job when loading content. It displays the TechCrunch logo in a generative fashion by building up the logo in parts to indicate the concept of loading. 
However, the TechCrunch website does a poor job of informing users of where they are on the website, or how they got there, or how to go back. This creates a sense of disorientation for the users with respect to the state of the system.

### 2. Match between System and the Real World
*(Speak the users' language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.)*

**Severity rating: 4**
**Evaluation:**
In the real world, when a user consumes news or information from sources like newspapers and magazines, information is systematically categorized in defined categories. For instance, the first page of a newspaper may contain important stories, and then the pages after that are dedicated to special topics. One page may be devoted to sports while the other may be for economics. The TechCrunch website does a poor job of matching the real world and categorizing their stories. While the homepage may display important stories, the rest of the website seems more like a content aggregate than a categorically organized place for information. 

### 3. User Control and Freedom
*(Users often choose system functions by mistake. Provide a clearly marked "out" to leave an unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.)*

**Severity rating: 3**

**Evaluation:**

Upon entering the TechCrunch website, the users have poor control over where they would like to go or the kind of content they can see. They are compelled to view the content that is presented to them as searching for content they wish to view is difficult. The lack of viewable categorization and easy search leads to a less personalized experience. 

### 4. Consistency and Standards
*(Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.)*

**Severity rating: 3**

**Evaluation:**
The TechCrunch Website uses somewhat consistent wording everywhere. However, some of the language it uses could be confusing to the user. For instance, right next to the ‘Gadgets’ category option, there’s an option called ‘features’. Since this is a tech info website, individuals may tend to think that the word ‘features’ refer to product or tech features, when in reality, they mean featured stories. 
In terms of visuals, the website does not follow many intuitive UX best practices like having the login function in the top right and mainting a constant navigation bar.  

### 5. Error Prevention 
*(Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.)*

**Severity rating: 2**

**Evaluation:**
The website does not give the user a warning if they are about to leave a page without completing a task. For instance if a user begins to comment on a post, it does not inform the user that the content would be lost if they exit. Another aspect that may lead to an error is that while creating an account, the user is not prompted to re-enter their password. While this may make the account creation process easy for the user, it may lead them to enter the wrong password and then have to go through the hassle of resetting it the next time they wish to login.

### 6. Recognition rather than recall
*(Make objects, actions, and options visible. User should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.)*

**Severity rating: 3**

**Evaluation:**
If the user is looking for specific content, they have to heavily rely on their own recollection to find the content. The TechCrunch search functionality is not easily accessible or intuitive. Furthermore, the information lacks visible categorization. The user has to go deep into the site and remember what they are looking for all throughout this process. The situation is made worse by the fact that the overwhelming amount of content displayed may distract the user and make it harder for them to discover what they are looking for. 

### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use 
*(Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users.  Allow users to tailor frequent actions.)*

**Severity rating: 3**

**Evaluation:**
The TechCrunch Website does a poor to cater to new users. It lacks the presence of consistent call to action buttons and leaves the user confused as to what their next steps should be. In some cases, because there is so many pieces of information and an abundance of clickables, the user may take a long time to advance through the website. This makes the website quite inefficient to use.

### 8. Aesthetic and minimalistic design
*(Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.  Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.)*

**Severity rating: 4**

**Evaluation:**
The TechCrunch website definitely lacks the minimalistic design because it is extremely crowded and often contains information that is irrelevant to the user. When a user clicks on an article to read, they are flooded with other recommendations, events, and settings. This makes it difficult for the user to fully enjoy the article they are reading and consequently reduces the value being delivered to users. 

### 9 Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 
*(Expressed in plain language (no codes).Precisely indicate the problem. Constructively suggest a solution.)*

**Severity rating: 4**

**Evaluation:**
The website does an extremely poor job of helping users recover from errors. Upon making a mistake while logging in, the website simply shows users the message that states “Uh-oh. We can’t sign you in right now. Please try again in a while.” It does not indicate to users what went wrong or what they should try fixing.Another example of poor error correction is the message “An error occurred with this page. Sorry for the inconvenience. ” While it informs the user than an error has occurred in provides no description of the error or guidance for the user to find a solution. This could get very frustrating for a user.

### 10. Help and Documentation 
*(Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Help information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.)*

**Severity rating: 3**

**Evaluation:**
The first issue with the help and documentation on TechCrunch is that it is difficult to find. It is embedded deep in the contact us part of the website and is not directly accessible. This is problematic because when a user has a problem to solve, if finding the solution is a long and difficult task, they are bound to be more frustrated. 
The second issue is that the help information is not documented well. This part of the website serves more as a place to report errors than to get a solution.
